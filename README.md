# This website shows the difference between a adaptive web page and a responsive web page.




  ***Adaptive and responsive websites both refer to the design approach for creating websites that work well on multiple devices with varying screen sizes. However, there   are some key differences between the two:

  Adaptive design: In this approach, the website layout changes based on specific pre-defined screen sizes, also known as breakpoints. The layout adjusts to fit the    device's screen by using different fixed-width designs for different screen sizes. This means that an adaptive website will have multiple layouts, one for each defined screen size.

  Responsive design: In this approach, the layout of a website automatically adjusts to fit any screen size, whether it is a desktop computer, tablet or mobile phone. The layout is fluid and flexible, adapting to the size of the screen. This is achieved through the use of CSS media queries and flexible grid-based layouts.***
